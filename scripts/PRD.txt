## MVP
1. Simple chat window on expense sorted
2. Connect to neon db that stores all of my bank transaction https://neon.tech/docs/ai/connect-mcp-clients-to-neon
3. Commands
	1. import new transactions (by selecting a bank file) --> could be linked to AMRs service later
	2. categorise bank transactions and ask for feedback on ones that it is uncertain of
	3. prebuilt reports:
		1. Generate a monthly report (calls the db and aggregates)
		2. shows the annual overview chart
	4. Ability to generate custom repots by fetching data from the db and generating charts with it.


## Ideas
* or i could simplify the UI of what we currently have for expenses
		* What if a single user had access to their bank transactions via an app
		* The app would be a bit like Chatgpt and would be able to read transactions, and store them in a database; it would also be able to read that database and produce charts
		* This could be a whole MCP architecture around this. store transactions, GPT reads them, converts them and then produces insights.
		* An AI version of this could look really simple and potentially later integrate into Google Sheets, a db, a chart framework have a set of prefab reports, but then also dynamically able to answer questions about the current expenses.
		* I could build this for myself
		* Tasks
			* Kind of like a ceo would ask his staff: "Give me an overview of how much I've been spending on groceries over the months"
			* How much has my rent been going up?
		* Can we have this with a voice interface
