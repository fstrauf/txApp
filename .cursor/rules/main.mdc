# Main Development Guidelines

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Use Next.js for all web development.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - Use Hono for endpoints that need to be reusable between the webapp and mobile.

- **API Keys & Secrets:**
  - Never store any keys or secrets directly in the codebase.
  - All keys and secrets must live in `.env` files.

- **Problem Solving:**
  - Always think from first principles. Aim to solve the root cause of issues, not just symptoms.
  - Keep solutions as simple as possible. Focus on providing a basic, working fix first.

- **Data Handling:**
  - No mock data. This is a production application; ensure real data handling is implemented.

- **Documentation:**
  - Do not create documentation, READMEs, or other `.md` files unless explicitly requested.

- **Package Management:**
  - Use `pnpm` as the package manager for all projects. Ensure all commands use `pnpm`.

- **Code Reusability:**
  - Ensure that any functionality intended for use by both web and mobile applications is created as a Hono endpoint.
