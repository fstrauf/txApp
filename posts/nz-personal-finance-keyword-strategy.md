## Content Gap Analysis

After analyzing top-ranking content, here are the key gaps your brand can fill:

### Missing Perspectives:

### Content Format Gaps:
1. **Interactive tools and calculators** embedded in articles
2. **Step-by-step implementation guides** with downloadable templates
3. **Comparison frameworks** that help users self-select rather than being sold to
4. **Personal case studies** with real numbers and outcomes
