# Beyond Rules: How Sentence Transformers Are Revolutionizing Transaction Categorization

If you've ever used a personal finance app like Quickbooks, Lunch Money, Monarch Money, or Tiller, you've likely experienced the frustration of maintaining endless rules to categorize your transactions. While these platforms offer valuable financial insights, they all share a common limitation: reliance on outdated rules-based transaction categorization systems that require constant maintenance.

Today, I want to introduce you to a fundamentally different approach that's changing how transaction categorization works: **sentence transformers**.

## The Problem with Rules-Based Categorization

Before diving into the solution, let's understand why traditional rules-based systems fall short:

1. **High maintenance burden**: Each new merchant requires creating and maintaining a new rule
2. **Rigidity**: Rules can't adapt to slight variations in transaction descriptions
3. **Limited context understanding**: Rules only match exact patterns without understanding meaning
4. **Scale limitations**: As your financial life grows more complex, rule maintenance becomes unmanageable

If you've ever had a transaction categorized incorrectly because the merchant description slightly changed, or found yourself creating dozens of rules for variations of the same business, you're experiencing these limitations firsthand.

## Enter Sentence Transformers: Understanding Meaning, Not Just Matching Patterns

Sentence transformers represent a paradigm shift in how we approach transaction categorization. Unlike rules that simply match patterns, sentence transformers understand the _meaning_ behind transaction descriptions.

### What Are Sentence Transformers?

Sentence transformers are specialized neural network models designed to convert sentences (in our case, transaction descriptions) into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.

Simply put: **Two transaction descriptions with similar meanings will have similar embeddings, even if they use completely different words.**

This capability is revolutionary for transaction categorization because:

1. **It understands context**: "AMZN Marketplace" and "Amazon.com" are understood as the same merchant
2. **It captures semantic relationships**: It can understand that "Shell Station" and "BP Gas" are both fuel purchases
3. **It learns from examples**: Rather than writing rules, you just need to provide examples of correctly categorized transactions

### The Technical Magic Behind Sentence Transformers

Without getting too technical, sentence transformers work by:

1. Breaking down transaction descriptions into tokens (words or parts of words)
2. Processing these tokens through multiple neural network layers
3. Generating a fixed-length numerical vector (embedding) that represents the meaning
4. Using this embedding to find the closest match among your previously categorized transactions

What makes this approach powerful is that once the model has been trained on a sufficient number of examples, it can accurately categorize new, previously unseen transactions based on their semantic similarity to known categories.

## Rules vs. Sentence Transformers: A Practical Comparison

Let's look at a simple example to illustrate the difference:

**Transaction description**: "PYMT COFFEE BROS #12 DOWNTOWN DISTRICT"

### Rules-Based Approach:
You would need explicit rules like:
- If description contains "COFFEE BROS", categorize as "Coffee Shops"
- If description contains "BROS COFFEE", categorize as "Coffee Shops"
- If description contains "COFFEE" and "BROS", categorize as "Coffee Shops"

If the merchant changes their name slightly or if you encounter a different coffee shop, you'd need to create new rules.

### Sentence Transformer Approach:
After training on a few examples of coffee shop transactions, the model would:
1. Convert "PYMT COFFEE BROS #12 DOWNTOWN DISTRICT" into an embedding
2. Compare this embedding with embeddings of previously categorized transactions
3. Recognize that this embedding is closest to other coffee shop transactions
4. Automatically categorize it as "Coffee Shops"

Even more impressively, it would likely correctly categorize "JAVA HOUSE ESPRESSO" as a coffee shop too, without any explicit rule for that specific merchant.

## Privacy-First Approach: Your Data Stays in Your Control

One common concern with AI-based approaches is data privacy. Unlike many cloud-based services that require uploading all your financial data, sentence transformer models can run locally:

1. **Your data stays in your Google Sheet**: All processing happens locally
2. **No cloud dependency**: You don't need to upload sensitive financial information
3. **Personalized to your needs**: The model learns from your specific transaction history and categories

## How Sentence Transformers Improve Over Time

The most significant advantage of this approach is that it gets better as you use it:

1. **Learning from corrections**: When you correct a miscategorized transaction, the model learns from that example
2. **Adapting to your personal preferences**: The model learns your specific categorization preferences
3. **Handling new merchants automatically**: New businesses are categorized based on similarity to known merchants

This creates a virtuous cycle where the system requires less and less intervention over time, unlike rules-based systems that demand constant maintenance.

## Hybrid Approach: Combining the Best of Both Worlds

While sentence transformers are incredibly powerful, we've found that a hybrid approach delivers the best results for transaction categorization:

1. **First pass with sentence transformers**: Most transactions (typically 85-90%) are accurately categorized using embedding similarity
2. **Confidence scoring**: The system calculates a confidence score for each categorization
3. **LLM backup**: For low-confidence transactions, a specialized LLM model provides additional context understanding

This multi-tiered approach achieves accuracy rates well above what's possible with either rules or embeddings alone.

## Real-World Results

Since implementing sentence transformer-based categorization in Expense Sorted, our Google Sheets finance extension, we've seen remarkable improvements:

- **85% reduction in manual categorization** compared to rules-based systems
- **95%+ accuracy** after training on just 50-100 transactions
- **Virtually zero maintenance** once the initial training is complete

Users report spending significantly less time managing their financial data and more time gaining insights from it.

## Getting Started with Modern Transaction Categorization

If you're tired of maintaining endless rules and want to experience the future of transaction categorization:

1. **Try Expense Sorted**: Our Google Sheets extension brings sentence transformer-powered categorization to your existing spreadsheets
2. **Start with your existing data**: The system can learn from your previously categorized transactions
3. **Watch the magic happen**: See how quickly the system learns your preferences and reduces your manual work

## Conclusion

The shift from rules-based to meaning-based transaction categorization represents a fundamental improvement in how we manage financial data. By understanding the semantic meaning of transactions rather than just matching patterns, sentence transformers deliver more accurate, more adaptable, and lower-maintenance categorization.

As financial data continues to grow in volume and complexity, these intelligent approaches will become essential for anyone seeking to maintain control over their financial information without spending hours maintaining fragile rule systems.
