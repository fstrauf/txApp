# Free NZ Expense Tracker for Google Sheets (2025 Edition)

*Stop paying monthly fees for budgeting apps when all you really need is a simple way to track where your money goes.*

After helping hundreds of Kiwis track their expenses over the past few years, I've learned that most people don't need complex budgeting software. They just need a straightforward way to import their bank transactions, categorize them, and see where their money actually goes.

That's exactly what this Google Sheets expense tracker does. It's designed specifically for the monthly workflow that works best for most New Zealanders: **download your bank transactions, categorize them, and understand your financial position.**

Best of all? **It's completely free, and your financial data stays 100% private**.

## What This Template Actually Does

*Complete financial overview showing expense tracking, savings rate, and financial runway - everything a Kiwi needs to understand their money*

Let me be upfront about what you're getting. This isn't a comprehensive financial planning suite—it's a focused expense tracking system that does four things really well:

### **1. Import Your Bank Transactions**
- Upload CSV files from any NZ bank
- Handles multiple accounts and file formats
- Simple copy-paste process that takes minutes

### **2. Categorize Your Expenses** 
- Smart categorization tool that learns your spending patterns
- Pre-loaded with common NZ expense categories
- Easily customizable for your specific needs

![AI-Powered Categorization](/es_ex_suggestion_adjustment.png)
*Smart categorization suggestions that learn your spending patterns and work with any NZ bank*

### **3. Track Monthly Spending Patterns**
- Automatic monthly rollups of all your categories
- Compare month-to-month trends
- Calculate your savings rate automatically

### **4. Monitor Your Financial Runway**
- See how long your money would last without income
- Track your cash flow trends
- Monitor savings vs spending balance

## Why Google Sheets Beats Expense Tracking Apps

Before diving into the template, here's why this approach makes sense for most Kiwis:

### **Complete Privacy Protection**
Your transaction data never leaves your Google account. No third-party companies analyzing your spending habits, no data breaches, no targeted advertising based on your financial behavior.

### **Zero Ongoing Costs**  
Budgeting apps charge $10-30 monthly. This template costs nothing, ever. Over five years, you'll save $600-1,800 that can go toward your actual financial goals.

### **Works with Any Bank**
Compatible with CSV exports from ANZ, ASB, Westpac, BNZ, Kiwibank, and any other New Zealand bank. No waiting for app integrations or dealing with broken connections.

### **Unlimited Customization**
Add categories that match your actual spending. Modify calculations for your specific situation. Scale complexity as your needs change.

## The Monthly Workflow (15 Minutes)

This template is built around a simple monthly routine that most people can stick to:

### **Week 1 of Each Month:**
1. **Download transactions** from your bank(s) for the previous month
2. **Import the CSV** into the Expense Detail tab
3. **Run the categorization tool** to assign categories to each transaction  
4. **Review and adjust** any miscategorized items

### **That's It.**

The Monthly Expenses tab automatically calculates your spending by category, savings rate, and financial runway. The Expense vs Savings tab shows your overall financial trend.

**Total time investment:** 15 minutes monthly after initial setup.

## Common Questions (And Honest Answers)

### **"Is this actually easier than using a budgeting app?"**
For most people, yes. Apps require constant account linking, often break when banks update their systems, and charge ongoing fees. This template requires 15 minutes monthly and costs nothing.

### **"What if I have multiple bank accounts?"**
The template handles multiple accounts easily. Just import each CSV file and the categorization tool will handle them all together.

### **"Will this help me budget better?"**
This template shows you where your money goes, which is the first step to better financial decisions. But it's not a budgeting tool—it's an expense tracking tool. Once you understand your spending patterns, you can make informed choices about where to cut back.

### **"How accurate is the categorization?"**
The tool gets smarter as you use it. Initially, you might need to manually categorize 20-30% of transactions. After a few months, it should handle 80-90% automatically.

### **"What if I mess something up?"**
Google Sheets automatically saves version history. You can always revert to an earlier version if needed. Plus, you're working with copies of your data, not the originals.

## What This Won't Do (Being Realistic)

This template focuses on expense tracking and financial awareness. Here's what it doesn't include:

**No Complex Budgeting Features:** If you want detailed budget planning with multiple scenarios, this isn't for you. It tracks what you spend, not what you plan to spend.

**No Investment Analysis:** While you can track investment balances, it won't analyze portfolio performance or provide investment advice.

**No Bill Management:** It doesn't track bill due dates or send payment reminders. It shows you what you spent, not what you owe.

**No Goal Planning:** It calculates your financial runway but doesn't help plan specific savings goals or retirement projections.

## The Real Cost Comparison

### **Popular Expense Tracking Apps (Annual Cost)**
- PocketSmith: $199
- YNAB: $199  
- MoneyLover Premium: $71
- Mint (discontinued, but was $120/year for premium)

### **Google Sheets Template (Annual Cost)**
- Template: $0
- Google Sheets: $0 (free tier sufficient)
- Your time: ~3 hours annually (15 minutes × 12 months)
- **Total cost: $0**

Even if you value your time at $50/hour, you'll save $150+ annually compared to premium apps.
