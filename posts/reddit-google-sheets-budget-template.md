# The Reddit-Approved Google Sheets Budget Template with AI Categorization

After spending months analyzing r/personalfinance, r/budgets, and r/financialindependence, one thing is clear: Reddit users want advanced Google Sheets features that don't exist in traditional templates.

They want automation without losing control. Privacy without sacrificing functionality. Power-user features without PhD-level complexity.

Here's the template Reddit has been asking for—with AI categorization features most users don't even know are possible.

## The AI Categorization Secret Sauce

Most Reddit users don't know this is possible in Google Sheets, but here's how it works:

### Behind the Scenes:
1. **Upload your bank CSV** → Transactions load into hidden "Raw Data" sheet
2. **AI processing** → Sentence transformers analyze transaction descriptions
3. **Pattern matching** → Compares against your historical categorizations
4. **Confidence scoring** → Auto-categorizes high-confidence matches
5. **Manual review** → Flags uncertain transactions for your input
6. **Learning loop** → Each correction improves future accuracy

### What This Means for You:
- **Week 1**: 60% auto-categorization (system learning your patterns)
- **Week 4**: 85% auto-categorization (recognizes most merchants)
- **Week 12**: 95% auto-categorization (fully trained on your habits)

**Time saved**: 15-20 minutes per week becomes 2-3 minutes per week
